**_Abstract:_**

_The characterization of spatiotemporal patterns of turbulent fluids in hydrodynamics (HD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is crucial to refine theoretical and computational approaches to turbulent systems. Furthermore, the increasing availability of high-resolution observational data from satellite constellations and drone-based sensing systems has made the automatic analysis of complex spatiotemporal structures an urgent challenge. In parallel, the emergence of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has opened new frontiers in the modeling of turbulent dynamics, particularly in complex environments such as space plasmas, which are directly relevant for data-driven space weather monitoring. In this context, we investigate the application of the Entropic Information Parameter Space (EIPS) - introduced in recent works - as a tool for refined classification of complex spatiotemporal patterns, highlighting those originating from fluid turbulence. In this complementary work, we focus on spatiotemporal data obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of 3D MHD and HD systems in particular cases where low Reynolds numbers are considered. Our results demonstrate that EIPS can effectively differentiate different turbulence regimes based on informational entropy metrics derived from velocity fields, highlighting structural divergences and convergences from large datasets. We argue that EIPS not only supports fundamental investigations of turbulence, but also provides a compact and robust analytical method for machine learning applications. This result is particularly relevant for training models that aim to detect, classify, and interpret 2D and 3D coherent structures in turbulent flows at several spatial and temporal scales under slightly different physical conditions._
